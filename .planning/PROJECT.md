# RN Dash

## What This Is

A Rust/Ratatui terminal UI dashboard for managing React Native worktrees. It provides a unified view of the currently running metro instance, all worktrees with their git/JIRA context, and quick access to git operations, RN commands, and Claude Code agents. Keyboard-driven with vim bindings and dynamic on-screen hints. Configurable for any React Native monorepo with git worktrees.

## Core Value

One place to see and control everything about your React Native worktrees — which one is running, what branch each is on, and execute any command without context-switching.

## Requirements

### Active

_(To be defined — next milestone via `/gsd-new-milestone`)_

### Out of Scope

- Mobile app or web UI — this is a terminal dashboard only
- Building or modifying the UMP React Native app itself — this tool manages it
- Real-time JIRA sync or ticket creation — read-only ticket title fetching
- Multi-user support — single-user tool

## Context

Shipped v1.1 Public Release — now at ~5,936 LOC Rust, published to GitHub as `rn-dash`.
Tech stack: Rust + Ratatui 0.30, tokio async runtime, crossterm, reqwest for JIRA, TOML config.
Architecture: TEA (The Elm Architecture) with domain/infra/app/ui separation.

- Works with any React Native monorepo (generalized from AJ/UMP in v1.1)
- Only one metro bundler can run at a time across all worktrees (enforced)
- User works in tmux or zellij, dedicating one window to this dashboard
- Branch naming convention configurable (default: JIRA-style PROJ-XXXX)
- Palette submenu keybinding scheme (a/i/x/y/g/w) with vim-style navigation
- Per-worktree command output persistence, FIFO command queue
- External metro conflict detection via port 8081 lsof
- Public GitHub release: MIT licensed, CI on macOS+Linux, tag-triggered prebuilt binaries (signed+notarized on macOS)

## Constraints

- **Tech stack**: Rust + Ratatui — no exceptions
- **Architecture**: Domain logic completely separated from UI and system concerns, following "A Philosophy of Software Design" by John Ousterhout
- **Environment**: macOS (primary), Linux (CI)
- **Config location**: Configurable, default ~/.config/rn-dash/ for JIRA token, preferences

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Rust + Ratatui for TUI | User preference, performance, type safety | ✓ Good — 5.5k LOC, fast startup, zero runtime crashes |
| Domain/UI/system separation | Ousterhout philosophy, testability, clarity | ✓ Good — clean module boundaries, deep modules |
| Kill + restart on worktree switch | Only one metro allowed, minimize manual steps | ✓ Good — seamless one-keystroke switching |
| Sync-before-run prompting | User-visible prompt replaced lazy auto-install | ✓ Good — more transparent than silent install |
| JIRA API with config token | Auto-fetch ticket titles for branch context | ✓ Good — Basic/Bearer auth, cached locally |
| ~/.config/ump-dash/ for config | XDG-style, separate from repo | ✓ Good — 0600 permissions on credentials |
| Multiplexer abstraction (tmux + zellij) | Support multiple terminal multiplexers | ✓ Good — clean trait boundary |
| Command queue (VecDeque) | Chain dependent commands, show queue count | ✓ Good — enables fetch-then-reset, release build flows |
| External metro conflict detection | Detect port 8081 already in use | ✓ Good — lsof-based PID lookup with kill prompt |
| Metro as prerequisite for RN runs | Auto-start metro before build commands | ✓ Good — prevents RN from spawning unmanaged metro |
| Remove labels feature | Unused in practice, added noise to domain/UI | ✓ Good — clean codebase, no regressions |
| Lowercase palette keys (w/d/b) | Consistency with other palettes, UAT feedback | ✓ Good — fixed in 08-04 gap closure |
| TOML over JSON for config | Better human readability and comments | ✓ Good — switched in 08-05 |
| Rename ump-dash → rn-dash | Generalize beyond AJ/UMP for public release | ✓ Good — shipped to GitHub |
| Config-driven repo paths, JIRA prefix | Remove hardcoded company-specific values | ✓ Good — works for any RN monorepo |
| macOS codesign + notarize in release | Avoid Gatekeeper friction for end users | ✓ Good — clean install experience |

## Current State

**Shipped:** v1.1 Public Release (2026-04-13) — app published to GitHub as `rn-dash`, CI + signed release binaries live. Post-ship quick tasks rolled into v1.2.0.

## Next Milestone

_To be defined via `/gsd-new-milestone`._ Candidate directions:
- Configurable keybinding overrides
- Theme / color customization
- Multi-project support (switch between RN repos)

## Evolution

This document evolves at phase transitions and milestone boundaries.

**After each phase transition** (via `/gsd-transition`):
1. Requirements invalidated? → Move to Out of Scope with reason
2. Requirements validated? → Move to Validated with phase reference
3. New requirements emerged? → Add to Active
4. Decisions to log? → Add to Key Decisions
5. "What This Is" still accurate? → Update if drifted

**After each milestone** (via `/gsd-complete-milestone`):
1. Full review of all sections
2. Core Value check — still the right priority?
3. Audit Out of Scope — reasons still valid?
4. Update Context with current state
